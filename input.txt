    HB:A B R A H A D A B R A
   418 = ChYTh = BYTh HA, the House of
He: because of I.Z.Q. 694; for HB:H
formeth HB:K, but HB:Ch formeth YVD: each
= 20.  Thus is Abrahadabra a Key
of the Pentagram.
  Also, by Aiq Bkr, it = 22: and
418 = 19 x 22.  19 = Manifestation;
it therefore manifests the 22 Keys of
R.O.T.A.
  The first meaning is ABRAH
DBR, = The Voice of the Chief Seer.
  It resolves into Pentagram and
Hexagram as follows:
1st "method."
  A
R/ \B
  A
A Pentagram A   forms 12 and 406, ChVA
 D H
B\ /R
  A
and AThH [406 = ThV], where AThH =
Microprosopus, and HVA = Macro-
prosopus.  The Arcanum is therefore
that of the Great Work
2nd "method."
           B
  A     R     H
A Pentagram A      Hexagram     Here BHR = 207
 A A    B     D
           R
= AYN SVP AVR, etc. and DBR = Voice
("The Vision and the Voice"); thus
showing, by Yetziratic attribution, the
Three Wands --- Caduceus: Phoenix:
Lotus.  Note always ABR are the
three Supernals.
3rd "method."
           A
  A     B     A
A Pentagram A      Hexagram     give 205 + 213;
 R B    H     D
           R
both mean "Mighty," whence Abra-
hadabra is "The Word of Double                          {44a}
Power."  AAB show AB: AIMA:
BN, viz., Amoun : Thoth : Mout.
By Yetziratic Method, H:D:R: are
Isis : Horus : Osiris.  (Also, for
H:D:R:, vide I.R.Q. 992.)
  Dividing as 3 and 8, we get  GR:Delta of
Horus dominating the Stooping
Dragon, ARR YAV: also ---
              A
from        R/_\B            we get
     A---B           A---H
     |   |           |   |
     A---D           R---A
8 = DD, Love, and 207 = AVR, Light;
8 x 207 = 18, which is equivalent to
ChY, living; further, 297 = 23 x 9 =
ChYH, Life: hence, Licht : Liebe :
Leben.
  Again, 418 = ATh + YAV, = 21 + 397,
q.v. DBR and 678 = 6 + 7 + 8 = 21.  2 x
HB:B + 2 x HB:R + HB:D = 32.  The Five different
letters represent Amoun : Thoth : Isis :
Horus : Osiris.  they (A + B + R + H
+ D) add to 212 (q.v.).
  Finally, HB:A is the Crown, HB:B the Wand,
HB:D the Cup, HB:H the Sword, HB:R the R.C.
  See Equinox, V and VII, for further
details.
